# Project Documentation:Algorithm Simulator

Start Date: 25th Feb 2025
End Date: 5th Mar 2025

## Project Overview
The **Algorithm Simulator** is a web-based tool designed to help users visualize and understand various searching and sorting algorithms. It allows users to input custom arrays, generate random arrays, and run different algorithms with step-by-step visualizations.

## Technologies Used
```plaintext
- HTML: Structure of the web application
- CSS: Styling and animations
- JavaScript: Algorithm implementations and interactivity
```

## Features
```plaintext
1. Algorithm Selection
   - Users can choose from different algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search, Sorting algorithms).
2. Custom & Random Arrays
   - Users can input a custom array or generate a random array.
3. Algorithm Execution & Visualization
   - Step-by-step execution with graphical representation.
4. Algorithm Explanation
   - Provides detailed descriptions and steps of the selected algorithm.
5. Interactive Buttons
   - "Run Algorithm", "Reset", "Show Algorithm Info", etc.
6. Themed UI Design
   - Dark purple-themed UI with animations and hover effects.
```

## Folder Structure
```plaintext
/algorithm-simulator
â”‚â”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”‚â”€â”€ style.css           # Styling and animations
â”‚â”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript logic for algorithms
â”‚â”€â”€ assets/             # Images, icons, and other assets
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Documentation
```

## How It Works
```plaintext
1. Select the algorithm type (Searching/Sorting).
2. Choose the specific algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter a number to search (for searching algorithms) or input a custom array.
4. Click "Run Algorithm ðŸš€" to see the visualization.
5. View the step-by-step explanation.
6. Reset or try a different algorithm.
```

## Future Enhancements
```plaintext
- Adding more algorithms (e.g., Graph algorithms, Dynamic Programming).
- Improving UI/UX for better interaction.
- Providing performance analysis for each algorithm.
```

## Conclusion
```plaintext
The Algorithm Simulator provides an interactive way for users to learn and understand algorithms efficiently. It was successfully developed within a week as part of our internship at Samnayastra, showcasing teamwork and technical skills in web development.
